DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fix the boundary conditions and geometry in the single beam column
  - Redo the simulations on single column

  Q - I reworked the boundary conditions and ran the simulations again but I did not get results I wanted.
      We can have a look at it live during the meeting and check what would work.

 - Perform 2x2 RVE simulations of cross shaped hole in 2D DNS analysis with horizontal and vertical periodicity.
  C - Discuss results

  Q - A much larger displacement is required to initiate buckling (both global and local) why?


 - Rewrite frame LBA with new b.c. and vertical periodicity on 2x2 RVE.
  Q - I implemented vertical and horizontal periodicity using Lagrange multipliers and spectral decomposition. But results are not in line
      with DNS simulations. Why? Would there be anything wrong about implementation of periodicity?


  Q - If so: I thought using Lagrange multipliers was not the right way so I tried to implement the condensation method. I am not sure how
      to do this correctly. I need some explanation.
