DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fix the boundary conditions and geometry in the single beam column
  - Redo the simulations on single column

   Q - I reworked the boundary conditions and ran the simulations again but I did not get results I wanted.
       We can have a look at it live during the meeting and check what would work.

 - Perform 2x2 RVE simulations of cross shaped hole in 2D DNS analysis with horizontal and vertical periodicity.
  C - Discuss boundary conditions  
  C - Discuss results 

  Q - A much larger displacement is required to initiate buckling (both global and local) why?

 - Rewrite frame LBA with new b.c. and vertical periodicity on 2x2 RVE.
  Q - I implemented vertical and horizontal periodicity using Lagrange multipliers and spectral decomposition. But results are not in line
      with DNS simulations. Why? Would there be anything wrong about implementation of periodicity?


  Q - If so: I thought using Lagrange multipliers was not the right way so I tried to implement the condensation method. I am not sure how
      to do this correctly. I need some explanation.

 - if done we can condense out entire matrix to estimate lateral spring stiffness

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Today's meeting centered around i) modeling of the single column buckling model and if we are able to get both global and local buckling 
   with this simple model ii) short analysis on the 2D DNS simulation for cross shaped holes iii) implementation of LBA for frames.
 - We started off by discussing the implementation of the single column model and whether it is able to capture both global and local
   buckling. The question was whether we are able to recreate the transition using only rotational springs located at both ends. 
   As it turns out it (most likely) not possible. We need some way of preventing translational motion at the top when increasing the spring
   stiffness. With rotational springs this is not possible since the bending of the beam moves towards the energetically most favourable
   configuration -> rotation angle with equal sings. For local buckling to occur these rotation angles should be opposite. which does not
   happen. Therefore we would need some form of translational spring in place to prevent sway (global buckling), which is already described
   in the paper I send Ondrej.
 - Next we discussed the results of the 2D DNS simulations. The results we obtained were in line with what we would want to see. For uniform
   (prismatic) beams we see that the 2x2 system buckles in the same manner as in global buckling. And if we increase the thick/thin ratio we
   see the local buckling pattern popping up.
   - The question about the large stretch required was answered: I implemented absolute displacement (as opposed to stretch which is a 
     percentage of the total size) and introducing vertical periodicity as well causes a much more stiff configuration hence larger
     displacements are needed to get result in the same buckle behaviour.
 - The last part we discussed was the implementation of horizontal and vertical periodicity in the frame model. The results of the vertical
   periodicity I showed of the frame model did not show perfect periodicty, here and there there were some discrepansies. He had the same
   thought process I had and related it to the method of Lagrange multipliers and spectral decomposition and suggested to choose for the
   condensation method instead. I had already thought of this and had some questions myself on the implementation of the condensation method.
   - Side comment: for perfect periodicity I should make the edge bars less half the thickness of the inner bars since due to periodicity
     they are simply copied to the other edge. If not they would be much more stiff than they should be.
 - If we could get the 2x2 frame model to work we could use it to estimate the lateral and rotational spring stiffnesses by condensitation
   of the entire frame into one parameter. This value could be used as an input value in for example a simple analytical model.
