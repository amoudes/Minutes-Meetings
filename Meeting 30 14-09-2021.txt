SUMMARY MEETING

 Comments code
 - Just before the meeting I had solved a bug that had caused wrong simulations for a few days. So I did not have the perfect preparation for
   the meeting. On the other hand my simulations right now showed good results and gave results that we would expect.
 - Ondrej had just a minor comment about how I took the inifinity norm to determine the magnitude of a vector, which in this particular case
   would work since the elements were aligned with the coordinate axis but in general would not. I changed "inf" to "2" and that should
   suffice.
 - Ondrej had another comment about the linearity of the code. Since we are only treating a pure linear problem the input force value should
   not matter. However for input values of 1 the resulting buckling mode did differ from smaller values. After a bit of investigation we
   found that using E = 1 and P = 1, the force value is too big and the eigenmode calculation falls back to numerical noise. So the eigenmode
   does not make sense. For smaller P values (or increasing the E) the critical buckling mode would be independent from the input force.
   So if we would want to use unit input force we have to increase the E, which is not a problem.
 - Ondrej also made a small comment about model validation. I checked the simple column model for numerical agreement with analytical Euler
   critical load, which matched perfectly. For completion I could do the same thing with a tall, slender, non-periodic column. It should give
   the same value.

 Results analysis
 - The results are very much in line with the DNS simulations. We see a global buckling region, transision region and a local buckling
   region.
 - From hereforth the question is how to move forward. Now that we have a working model the question is can we think of an simpler model that
   can describe the same thing. If not we stick to the current model. Simplification of the model is difficult if not impossible. We need the
   number of layers to simulate global buckling and we need a minimum of two horizontal layers for periodicity in the case of local buckling.
   So as it stands right now the current model seems to be the simplest representation of the system at hand (though it already comes very
   close to the full 2D DNS simulation).
 - If we were to use the current model the next logical question is how we could capture global buckling and the transition to local buckling.
   We already discussed this before in previous meetings but how we see it right now is that we could either extend the MM to second order 
   FE2. This enforces a higher order continuum on the deformation and should connect the shearing modes (since you also include rotational
   continuum, just as in beams). This would prevent the individual shearing modes of each unit cell and connect it overall. It would however
   include a third order tensor in the deformation decomposition which would make the overall derivation more techniqual. In addition we
   would need more (complex) orthogonality constraints on the microfluctuation field (to prevent two parts of the model to describe the same
   thing) and need to extend the boundary conditions. The latter could be problematic since we would not really know what to prescribe for
   this higher order continuum.
 - Another possibility would be to describe these higher order deformation (bending) effects using the micromorphic fields. Ondrej recently
   read a paper in which it stated that it would be possible to decompose this third order tensor into 9 different parts. This could be a
   suitable option. We however do not know what these deformations look like. This is something I can invesitage using my beam model.
   Using the patterning modes we hopefull are able to establish some connectivity on the global level and thus describe global buckling.
 - So to recap: 1) describe higher order continuum using second order FE2 2) describe higher order continuum using patterning modes.
 - A way to tackle this is to first look at the type of deformation of the unit cells after removal of the linear first order components.
   This can be done using linear least square projections on the deformed unit cells.
   By looking at the deformation we see then we should be able to move forward. Ondrej expects a trapezoidal shape and/or C shape to come
   out after backdeformation.
