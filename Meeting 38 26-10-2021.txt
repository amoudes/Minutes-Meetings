SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Meeting with Ron and Ondrej
 - In this meeting we discussed the progress over the last two weeks. 
 - We discussed how we proceede with the single column and how we wanted to proof that the beam only buckls globally when having without
   lateral bracing (spring or contact). Since we wanted to know if if the beam ever buckles locally with added rigid parts we were tried to
   extend the model into that direction but the derivation turns out to be more difficult than we expected.
   Since we are interested in the effect of the horizontal bars as well Ron suggested not to spend too much time any more on this single
   column model.
 - What Ron had in mind after the previous meeting was something with a rigid island that rotated and an energy approach where we would
   determine the stored energy in the system. For this we would use the deformed state as (as opposed to the buckled state) and then determine
   the stored energy. Since this would involve non-linear effects we did not go into this direction before however as the other approach also 
   turns out to be difficult we will try this method as well.
 - For both configurations (global and local) we would use the deformed, post-buckled state to determine the internal energy in the L-bracket.
   The more preferential state would be the state with the lower internal energy and hopefull we would see an intersection of the two energies
   meaning that the transition occurs at that point.
 - The local deformed state would be easier to do as we have only 1 DOF, the global state is more difficult as we would need the relation
   between sway Delta and rotation.
 - We discussed more things about simplifying the model more but could not find easier approaches.
 - The eneryg approach assumes no compression in the axial direction. I could test if this holds true is I make the axial stiffness very large
   and if that does not lead to very large buckling values.

 Meetin with Ondrej in the afternoon
 - During this meeting we discussed more the techniqualites and implementations and the questions I had from previous week.
 - The extention of the analytical model by Ochoa could be made simpler by putting the origin of the deflection at the lower point of the 
   leaf spring and only adding the rigid parts in the moments. This would yield a non-linear system and could be made linear by assuming 
   small rotations.
 - I wanted to implement the L-bracket without the aid of additional nodes and very rigid elements so that I truly have only three DOF left.
   A solution for this would be hanging nodes and linking the nodes of the leaf spring to the hanging nodes.

TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Verify axial compression (make it very large and check for noteable effects).
 - Perform eneryg approach for local and global buckling
 - Derive equations for column with rigid sections using new insights.
 - Hangning nodes in for FE implementation using transformation matrix.
 - Translation from L-bracket to single column using stiffness matrix condensation (as I did before).
