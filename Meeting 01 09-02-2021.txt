 OUTLINE
- Prep phase 4-6 weeks
- In this period determine goal. Make it clear.
  Define steps
  Individual building blocks
  Desicions on coding language etc.
- Determine planning based on findinds and on decisions
- Project phase starts after this and lasts 6-8 months
 

- topology research
- collaboration topology optimization Expert - Ole Sigmund
- extra supervisor Ron Peerlings
  mainly contact for Ron and Ondrej
- My primary contact person will be Ondrej
  Weekly meeting every tuesday 11:00
  Every other week a meeting with Ron

 GENERAL IDEA PROJECT
Individually models and theory exists. However as the scale factor in our particular problem is not that large,
splitting the problem up into two is not perfectly possible since microstructure affects topology optimization
and vice versa. Hence the goal is to design a homogenization model that combines the two. Other factors like
non-linearity, instabilities, etc also come into play, though the exact details at this point are a bit vague
and hopefully will become more clear upon reading.


The project is a pilot project for topology optimization in combination with microscale homogenization.
Quite some freedom on what we actually want to do.

Keywords:
- inverse homogenization
- non-local buckling model
- micro-morphic

- two problems:
 - topology optimizatoin
 - non-local problem

- non-linear applications

connect the two
connection is possible only local

coupling (homogenization) is the challenging part

design of both scales
connect

SUGGESTIONS UPCOMING WEEK
- read papers on topology
- first two weeks reading on topology, homogenization (and more)
  Try to understand basics of topology optimization and homogenization

- Idea is that I own the theory and applications and are able to answer questions
- Use of existing models
