Detailed notus meeting

First report remarks:
 - General structure
  1) Start off with some kind of introduction that provides the context in which this report is written. Give 
     information about metamaterials, graded microstructure and show some images. Also mention importance of
     buckling
  2) Rewrite the multiscale TO. Include broader view of current methods. Better define the nice we are looking at.
     Do this by discussing what has been done and shooting holes into it.
     Include issues like compatibility issues
                         patterning modes
                         coupling between individual cells
                         coupling macro-micro through homogenization
                         only linear elastic cases - no non-linear
     In order to do so I first have to do more research on the papers. Start off by looking at citations and
     references of the papers Ondrej sent me.
   
     Question: What to do with compatility between cells?
     - Suggestion: if we optimize microstructure with respect to a predetermined patterning mode we hope to find
       that cell compatibility is automatically satisfied. If not we can employ methods to do so, like full boundary
       prescription methods, they are computationally expensive though.
 
     Question: What to do with large computational times?
     - Answer: This project mainly serves as a proof of concept. Optimizing the code w.r.t. efficiency is not part
       of the goal and comes in later stages.
  3) Problem definition -> include bullet list of most important goals of the project. Give a detailed breakdown
     in the section 4 Research plan.
     
     Also it is possible to write the problem definition with a specific goal in mind making the project less
     abstract. During the project we can find some kind of end application. Right now that being the orthopaedic
     implants.

 - Research plan.
  - The entire project can actually be categorized into three parts of which the first two are the most important
    
    Part I - Homogenization
     - In this part we will test the limitations of the micromorphic computational homogenization scheme.
     - The most important aspect of this section is to really understand the patterning modes.
     - Starting point: Perform limit tests by (i)   Using different RVE orientations
                                              (ii)  Scaling hole sizes
                                              (iii) ...
       Comparison with DNS will provide information about accuracy of MM scheme
     - Investigating how to determine patterning modes
      - Graded microstructure

    Part II - Topology Optimization
     - This part will most definitely be bigger than the first part. Here implementation of the MM scheme in TO is 
       the final goal. Substeps are:
      - Single cell microstructure optimization
       - Investigate microstructure topology optimization w.r.t. a patterning mode(s)
       - What type of solver to use
       - Penalization methods (SIMP, level-sets,...)
       - Linear elastic
       - Non-linear optimizatin
       - Buckling/bifurcation analysis
      - Include the homogenization scheme stepwise
        - first-order homogenization scheme
        - (second-order) homogenization scheme
        - ....other methods....
        - Micromorphic homogenization scheme
      - Multi cell microstructure optimization
       - Investigate microstructure topology optimization w.r.t. a patterning mode(s)
       - Non-linear optimizatin
       - Buckling/bifurcation analysis
   
  **Part III - Multi-scale topology optimization (MM + TO)** 
     - Patterning mode testing on graded microstructure
     - Compatibility testing

     - *Not well defined yet as we might not have enough time to include this within the 8 month project*

 - Further comments
  - If all goes well next tuesday we will have the first meeting with Ron.
    As for preparation I will have to finish the first draft of the preparation report by then.
  - Midterm presentation - this will probably be after I wrapped up the homogenization part of the project and when 
    I have the first results of the TO
  - Project planning remark - The defence is also part of the project phase and usually you have it three weeks
    before the final presentation. Make sure to plan it ahead. Also the final report should mostly be finished by the
    time of the defence.
  - Priorities this week:
   1) Finish research plan - give a detailed breakdown of the entire project
      Send the finished plan a.s.a.p. to Ondrej. Preferably before thursday so that he can give comments on Friday or
      we can have a meeting on thursday.
   2) Do more research on multiscale TO - rewrite the sections after
   3) Write introduction, problem statement and workout further comments by Ondrej.
