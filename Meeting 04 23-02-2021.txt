NOTES DURING MEETING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continuation of questions from the previous meeting.

- we discussed adjoint method

- checkerboarding - method that is mostly used is averaging of densities
                  - filtering of sensitivities is also used in the book

- further reading - non linear topology optimization p86
                    buckling optimization is also interesting to read p86

- Ondrej will send me a few papers on non-linear buckling topology optimization

Discussion

- Optimization of E on the microscale

- Read non-linear and buckling

- Buckling of coupling on microscale and macro scale

- Next part: write preparation report



DETAILED SUMMARY MEETING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We discussed details of the adjoint method. This method allows to implicitly determine the derivative of a
  function and is computationally much more favourable then finite differences.

- We discussed checkerboarding and ways of preventing it. In most cases an averaging filter is applied. This
  involves a convolution operator which Ondrej explained as well.  

- We had a small discussion on the structure of the entire graduation project.
  Typically 4-6 weeks are used for the preparation phase which is a bit longer than usuall. This is done to really
  prepare well for the project phase, because when it starts your deadline is set and the clock starts ticking.

  Halfway through the project I will have to do a MoM-meeting presentation
  At the end I have to hand in my project report and defend my thesis in front of a jury, which is a closed door
  meeting of ~30min with Ondrej, Ron and some other teachers.

- For this week I will have to do two things:
  1) Read on non-linear TO in the book. This includes optimization for bucklinkg

  2) Write preparation report section on the background information

- Next week when I have sufficient background information, we will start discussing the goals and the details of
  the project. We maybe start divinding the project up into blocks of work.
