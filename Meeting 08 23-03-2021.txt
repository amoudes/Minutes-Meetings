Meeting 08 23-03-2021

Attending:
 Thijs Oudes
 Ondrej Rokos
 Ron Peerlings

DISCUSSION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Points last week:
  - Preparation report second draft

- What is the goal of Part III. Discuss what to do with this part.
- p6 - Discuss notation TO.
- p9 - What do you mean by domain decomposition?

- patterning modes needs to be continuous to enforce compatibility
- wave length of a mode
- need a plan B, project sounds very ambitious
 - multi-scale buckling analysis is already very difficult and ambitious
- change wave length of the patterning mode at the macroscale
 - optimize microstructure for wavelength
- simplified model: fixed microstructure, distort lattice with fixed microstructure. spatially varying period,
                    additional struts.
  another goal:     fix period, start optmizing the microstructure
- Maybe include another part in between I and II in which we assume fixed microstructure varying period. 
  Regular array of beams for that microstructure come up with fluc functions, allow freedom at microstructure to 
  change fluc func at macroscale. Design freedom of microsturcture (smaller wider).
- Part III - fix pattern, design pattern according to predetermined patterning mode.
- After part I, I could start to work on parts II and III parallel to see where to allocate the most time.

- start date could still be 23rd 

- change paper and send it to Ondrej and Ron

- 

SUMMARY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First meeting with Ron. Unfortunately he was not fully able to read my preparation report before today's meeting so
I had to explain the setup and plan for the project. 

He had several comments:
 - Project seems like a lot of work and is ambitious. Nothing wrong with being ambitious but one should not aim too
   high.
 - He proposed to include a step between Parts I and II. Since we already had some doubts about part III we would let
   go of that part and focus on I and II.
 - Since part III was already somewhat risky we included more safe and doable ideas in part I and II.
 - The plan as it is does not require a lot of changes. It only requires some reformulations of parts I and II.
 - The idea of wavelength/period was something quite important. Ondrej had assumed it constant but Ron had doubts
   about how realistic it was and about the uniqueness of the solution if it remained open.
 - Therefore step inbetween I and II would focus on optimizing the microstructure w.r.t. stability (highest critical
   buckling force) for fixed microstructure where we change some key characteristics, such as RVE size, hole size,
   ligament thickness, etc...
 - In part I we would then investigate the limits of the computational homogenization scheme and see how big the
   design window is. In part II-new we would subsequently play with the design window to find an optimal
   optimal microstructure w.r.t. buckling force with varying period.
 - Part II-old remains as it is and here we focus on designing a microstructure according to a predescribed patterning
   mode with fixed period.
 - Part II-new would therefore be a small step towards multi-scale buckling. But we know it is doable so low risk.

After I had a meeting with just Ondrej, here we discussed:
 - Summarizing meeting with Ron.
 - Setting up plans for this week. I can already send an invite to Ondrej for looking through the micromorphic code in
   the repository. There are a few technicalities that require explaining.
 - Work on the report. Change it and send it to Ron and Ondrej so they can check. Only sections 3, 4, 5 need new
   comments. Sections 1 and 2 are already okay. 

Tasks this week:
 - Adapt the prep. report according to the things we discussed in the meeting
 - Set a date for meeting with Ondrej for looking into micromorphic code
 - Write the project phase document and send it to mech office.
