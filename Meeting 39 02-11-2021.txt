SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Energy approach
 - During the first discussion we talked about the energy approach and the derivation I made for the local buckling pattern
 - It turns out that since I prescribe the displacement I do not have a contribution of work done by external forces which makes sense. I
   only have a contribution of the elastically stored energy so the answer for prismatic beams is quite straight forward and already there in 
   the derivation.
 - The extension with rigid rods had some mistaktes. I included the length of the horizontal part instead of the length change of the vertical
   part of the rigid bar. So I need to change that part.
 - What we also found out is that we a linearization of the problem will not help with finding the energy of the system since then the length
   change due in the rigid bar is set to zero. We will need to incorporate a higher order term (quadratic) to make sure we see a length change.
   This makes the equations a bit more difficult but still solveable. This I will have to do soon.
 - To verify whether the energy approach is accurate I can take the partial deriative of the energy with respect to the applied deformation to
   obtain the critical buckling force. If this is constant it should correspond to the critical buckling force in the DNS cases. Hopefully
   they are somewhat accurate.
 - We also disccused the extension of enegy approach to the global buckling pattern. Since we have two degrees of freedom here the derivations
   are a bit more technical. I have to determine what the deflection shape looks like as a function of the sway and the rotation angle. And 
   since we have two degrees of freedom finding the minimum energy value is not as straight forward. Ondrej suggested to use fix one of the
   variables and find the minimum energy of the other then so we obtain the ratio between of the two values that satisfies the minimum energy.
 - Before however committing to the global bucklink mode derivation we first verify the first mode and we can do the derivation then together.
   I'll have a meeting with Ondrej on Thursday morning where we can discuss things furhter.

Substitution approach
 - Next we discussed the substitution of the rigid section in the stability analysis.
 - There was some back and forth about how I implemented the transformation but as the DNS lines up with the transformation using a static
   equilibrium problem for various cases we assumed it to be correct.
 - One thing that we could not place are the values of the rotations as we obtain large rotation values that do not make a lot of sense if
   they are in radians.
 - Where static equilibrium equations work well with the transformed matrix, stability analysis equations do not. The transformation matrix
   on the geometric stiffness matrix is not of sufficient high order. Since equal transformation is applied on both matrices the same 
   lambda is acquired.
 - This was unexpected for Ondrej as he had expected the transformation would work.
 - Since this approach did not yield the wanted results we will proceed with the energy approach.

Report 
 - The outline of the report is still not fully set.
 - We can make a distinction between the exploring the design space and the investigation in the global and local buckling pattern. 
 - We can follow this distinction and write the report in part A and part B but this would yield two seperate thesises bascially which
   is not ideal. 
 - It depends on the outcome of part B how we will structure the report
 - Monday we have a meeting with Ron as well and then we can also discuss the report structure.
