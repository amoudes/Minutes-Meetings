SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cubic interpolation
 - First we discussed briefly the plotting issue with the rotations. It is most likely something with the rotations. They seem to be too big.
 - Though we could dive deeper into it, Ondrej intervened and rightly said so that it is not owrht the time which makes sense.

Single column
 - Next we discussed the analytical approach to prove local buckling does not occur when we only have a single column.
 - We first discussed the approach I took using the paper by Ochoa that uses analytical equations to obtain the critical buckling force for a
   clamped to pinned columns. Ondrej considered the graph I showed sufficient proof for a prismatic beam to buckle always globally when
   when side sway is not inhibited and having two rotational springs on the top and bottom.
 - However when we were thinking about the simplifications we made we considered that we might have simplified too much. We simply translated
   the problem to the leaf spring and assumed the rigid part does not affect the behaviour of the leaf spring. We considered this too be too
   coarse of an assumption and we decided that we did have to take the rigid sections into account. 
 - This means that we will have to redo the derivation but then for the rod extended. This could be more difficult since the DE is more 
   difficult. But we will have to see what comes out.
 Secondly we discussed the two element approach
 - I showed that indeed the internal energy is lower for globally swaying than local buckling which is nice. However Ondrej was not fully
   convinced of the model. We would have to proof that the global buckling is always lower than local buckling for every ratio of c1/c2.
   Ondrej thinks the first approach is neater since we have a continuous column.

L-bracket
 - There is a small difference between the frame and l-bracket model. We manage to probably find the problem which is that the normal force
   is not zero for the horizontal elements after we compress it. I can hardcode it to make sure to solve it. Hopefully this will make sure
   we have a 1-to-1 comparison between frame and l-bracket.
 - Ondrej had hoped to gain more insight in which parts of the stiffness matrix are enforced and weakened by applying the perodicity
   constraints. Unfortunately this turned out to be more complex than he had thought.
 - To see the transition between the two buckling modes we could model the solid sections as islands and then perform a similar stiffness
   matrix comparison as before. It would likely yield also a 3x3 matrix when we use 1 element for hor and ver.


TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 x Verify and correct difference between L-bracket and 2x2 frame.
 - Derive and compute effective length of single column with rigid parts added using model from paper Ochoa.
 - Extend the L-bracket model to take into account the leaf springs and rigid parts with variable length and perform stiffness matrix
   analysis.
 - plot modes using analytical equations Ochoa.
