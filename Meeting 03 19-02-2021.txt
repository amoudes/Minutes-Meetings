 Bendsoe & Sigmund - Topology Optimization

General questions:
 - p3  Need some explanation on mathematical formulation of a(u,v).
       How to interpret a(u,v)?
       Why include arbitrary virtual displacement v strain term in energy bilinear form?
 - p7  SIMP dot not necessarily lead to an existing solution. Why?
 - p10 I don't fully understand the derivations on this page.
       Lagrange multipliers are introduced here again. Why are they necessary here?
       How to interpret Eq. (1.12)?
 - p15 Why is a sensitivity analysis step required in TO?
       (From what I have understood, sensitivity analysis prevents checkerboard patterning and enables
        mesh convergence.)
 - p17 Adjoint method is mentioned in multiple papers on TO. What is it and how does it work?
	-> Simple way of computing gradients
 - p18 How do they obtain Eq. (1.17)?
 - p19 Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) is introduced with mathematical details. I understand it is used as an
       optimization method which is especially useful for problems with a lot of constraints. I do not understand
       the working principle and implementation in the TO though.

Further sections of this chapter discuss methods to obtain a converging solution upon mesh refinement and
to prevent checkerboard patterns. I understand why they are necessary though and I do have questions about them
but at this point in the project they are not that relevant in my opinion.

 Sigmund - A 99 line topology optimization code written in Matlab

This paper provides a commentary on a simlpe 2D Matlab implementation of a minimum compliance problem by 
Ole Sigmund. It serves as a good starting point for TO and is very useful for educational purposes.

General questions:
 - Eq. (2) why unclude m? - This is the same parameter as zeta in the book no p10.
 - I fully understand the optimal criteria (OC) based optimizer. For more simpler problems OC is more often to 
   update the design criterion (as opposed to MMA). Therefore I think that it is important that I understand how
   it works.

DISCUSSION
 - In later stage if we want to improve the optimization procedure we can introduce level set instead of SIMPs


 - Discuss goal of project again
  - Inverse homogenization
  - Bifurcation buckling
 - Further reading?
 - Project phase report
  - write homogenization
  - write micromorphic homogenization
  - Topology optimization
