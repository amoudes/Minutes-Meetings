SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Circ-to-square study
 - We followed the structure of the slides to structure the meeting. We started off with discussing the deformation of holes with increasingly
   rounded corners until circular holes are obtained. The first thing Ron adresssed was how the deformation of the square holes actually looks
   like. From the images it seemd that the vertical ligaments are mostly not bent and that there is no zig-zag (sine-wave) deformation in the
   horizontal ligaments. However the image in the slides is too vague to draw clear conclusions. I should revisit the results and have a 
   closer inspection.
 - He suspected that the stiffness of the microstructure was quite high post-bifurcation. I could check this by comparing with previous results
   and the paper by Silvia.
 - If we would tidy things up, instead of keeping the hole size constant we would keep the totall mass constant. Right now we compare micro-
   structures with different masses which is not a perfectly neat comparison.
 
 Analytical model:
 - Ron had a few comments about the analytical model. First of all my proposal to model to use portal frames was not in line with what he had
   in mind. The competition between sway and non-sway structures he understood but the parallel of adding horizontal springs he could not
   follow. His main point was the physical interpretation of the springs (what do these stiffnesses actually mean?). He did agree with the
   conclusions I drew about the about the three regimes in the global-to-local buckling transition but the analytical model could be more neat.
 - He suggested a different approach to modeling an (semi-) anlaytical model. First he suggested a numerical approach in wich we would simulate
   the holes as ligaments divided into segments with each segment having a different cross section. One could think of it as a cross-shaped
   hole. The reason for this is that he suspects that the deformation of a repeating unit cell of square holes depends on the relative thickness
   of each segment with respect to one another. For this assumption is it very important to have a good idea how the deformation of such
   repeating cell looks like. He assumes that for square holes the largest bending moment occurs at a 1/4 and 3/4 the beam. By increasingly
   approaching circular holes, the thickness at those location increases and thus the largest bending moment shifts to the thinner parts being 
   1/2 the beam length.
 - So Run suggests two approaches:
   i)  Numerical simulations using segmented beams with different cross-sectional areas. Essentially testing cross-shaped holes. If we see the
       same behaviour for these holes as for the DNS simulations with continuous beams we have very good understanding of what is actually
       happening.
   ii) Analytical approach. He first suggested an approach in which we would model a repeating element element: basically a connection point
       between vertical and horizontal elements. Here we would divide the beam up again in to segments and enforce periodicity horizontally and
       vertically.
       After showing my single column model he changed his mind and thought of this approach as a an even better one. Here we would divide the
       column up into eight segments and set the ratio between elements. For a uniform beam we would find the Euler critical load. For non-
       uniform beam we would expect a partial transition zone and eventually a non-swaying structure.
       Modelling the second approach could be done in Marc but also in the existing Matlab environment in which I have been working up to now.

 Testing multiple modes:
 - In this part of the meeting we took a quick look at the results of the MM model using different patterning modes.
 - The shear mode I tested the MM with did give results as we would expect though Ron was not particulary fond of them. The v0 component of
   deformation decomposition should take care of this shear type behaviour hence Ron was surprised to see that this shear mode gave results.
   What he suggested was to subtract the v0 deformation mode from the total deformation and try to find a patterning mode that describes the
   resulting wave like deformation.
 - In fact, a better approach would be to let the deformation mode follow from the analytical model. This also justifies and construction and
   development of the analytical model.

TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Develop and run DNS simulations of microstructure with cross-shaped holes. (Segmented beams with variable thickness).
 - Develope analytical model of single segmented column with variable thickness.



 - Questions for next meeting Ondrej
	- What would be a good way to nicely input mesh parameteres in matlab? Righ now I need to define every mesh parameter 
          in the create RVE file even for meshes I do not need.
