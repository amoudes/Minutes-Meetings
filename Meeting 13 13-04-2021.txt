DISCUSSION

Questions

Microscopic problem:
 - Comment: I notice that for micro stiffness in paper D is used and in code C. This is confusing.
 - Eq (20-25) where can I find them in the code?
 - Paper mentions Dww*. Where is this used in the code?

Macroscopic problem:
 - For confirmation: P = theta^ig, Q = Lambda^ig, R = Pi^ig
 - Why again condens out w and Lagrange multipliers?
 - Lines 526-534. Filling in K00e, K0ie, Kiie from Ke. I don't understand why?
 - How do the patterning modes exactly work.
    From what I understand you specify a specific deformation you know beforehand on the RVE and you determine the "size" v_i on
    that Gauss interpolation point. Then I don't really understand how cells are able to communicate information with each other.

    It can also be that you prescribe a global deformation, but then how does the RVE know how to deform? In this way you have 
    communication but how do you know a RVE should deform?
 - solver_micromorphic.m - line 33 - Why duM = 0*f? and not duM = 0?
 - Running the code takes quite a while. Lots of unstable microsolver messages. Why?
 - engergy_micromorphic_2d.m - line 305 - What is EH?
 - Eq (1)/(2) p4 - Do you actually add up the three compoments to get the macroscopic deformation?
   Is this somewhere in the code?

Points of discussion
 - Cluster tutorial
 - Set-up limitation experiments
  - column, change radius size.
  - try to implement different RVE mesh
  - different hole size depending on location
  - each gauss point has its own RVE
  - start off with regular FE2 and DNS
  - sine function / linear function for hole diameter
  - add switch in MM code such that FE2 is obtained. C = [];
     
  - Progressively work to periodic stacking of holes
  - second step. Offset holes from perfect alignment
  - For comparison I can P22 same Fig. 7  

  - create my own branch

  basic testing can still be done on my laptop
  
 - Analytical solution check, Euler beam.
