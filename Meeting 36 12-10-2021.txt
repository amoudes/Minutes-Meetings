SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single column model
 - We spent quite some time discussing the single column beam. From the simulations I showed that under all conditions the beam buckles in
   the global manner.
 - So from what we see is that the beam will always prefer global buckling but it is not a proof. Since Ron alluded to it multiple times we 
   would want to have a more solid (analytical proof) why the beam will always buckle globally. Most of the time during the meeting was spent
   on thinking about a proof.
 - In short what we though about:
   - If we take the thick parts of the beams as solid we are able to translate the problem to only the compliant leaf spring part of the
     beam. This leaf spring part can buckle either globally or locally and thus we only scale the problem down to this spring.
   - At first we hoped to find that the effective length K of the local buckling was smaller than the global one since this would mean that
     global buckling would alwys occur first. However they both have the same effective length (Keff = 1.0) thus they also have the same
     wave length.
   - Where we think the difference lies the requried energie to counter rotate the two springs above the shearing. So we think that the
     internal energy using the integral over 1/2EIk^2(x)dx is the same and the additional term for local buckling is the 1/2cphi^2 but it is
     not proven.
   - The comparison we had before where we have local buckling for c = 0 and global for c = inf can not be compared it is like comparing two
     different situations (apples and pears so to say). Thus we need to make a fare comparison.
   Possible proofs:
   1) Use the solution from the unhinhibited column from the paper by Ochoa and see if it is possible to obtain local buckling using their 
      equations.
   2) Discretize the thin beam using three nodes with rotational springs at each node. ctop = cbot = c1, cmiddle = c2. Compress is using 
      unit force. Compute the total internal energy using work done, stored energy in springs and plot the energy for a lot of combinations
      of c1 and c2. Hopefully the global buckling will always have lower energy than the local buckling.

L-bracket
 - The L-bracket simulations showed almost the same behaviour as the full 2x2 frame model. The L-bracket gives slightly higher critical loads
   which Ondrej did not expect, he expected near perfect similarity. So somehow the b.c. on the L-bracket are a bit too strict. We could
   explain it by saying that the L-bracket assumes perfect symmetry between horizontal and vertical ligaments. While we see that it is not
   the case in the 2x2 frame (there is a small difference between the horizontal and vertical buckling columns).
 - But all in all, the L- bracket model seams very promising as the results are very similar.
 - To move forward to an analytical model I can model the prismatic L-bracket using only a single element for each ligament giving a 3x3
   reduced stiffness matrix that allows us to solve the eigenvalue problem by hand.
 - Also using this 1 element/beam configuration we can clearly study the effects of pre-stress on the beams by means of the reduced Kg.
   I can clearly see for global and local buckling which elements in the stiffness matrix are strenghtened and weakened by the Kg.
 - Lastly we briefly touched upon modeling of non-prismatic beams by means of the leaf spring approach suggested by Ron. I ran simulations
   using this approach and found out that we can indeed describe the transition between the two buckling phenomena by increasing the size
   of the rigid islands. We can hopefully do a similar thing for the L-bracket.

Side-comment:
 - For plotting, the used interpolating functions are cubic in nature hence linear plot between nodes can be taken to higher order by also
   including rotations. I should tweak the plotmesh function therefore.
