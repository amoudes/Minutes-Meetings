SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 - Meeting with Ron was quite fruitfull. He had some good ideas on the future of the project.
 - I think he got the main idea from where we started and how the project had evolved over the last couple of monthts up to now. Slides
   were quite helpful and provided good insights in what decisions we took. Though the slide with the problems of the FE2 and MM was a bit 
   confusing.
 - He quite quickly got the point of where we are at the moment and the decision we would need to make on where to focus on in the project.
 - We discussed the problems with the competition between global and local buckling and the crossroads we are at the moment.
 - Options:
  1) Stick to microstructures that we know work with the micromorphic code and keep on the road to optimization on both scales with respect
     to buckling. Although this is the original direction we would want to take the project it largely overlooks the problem we have with
     rectangular holes and we shut the door for a large amount of microstructures.
  2) Alter the micromorphic code such that it is able to work with these rectangular holes. This is the more difficult option of the two. As
     we currently do not know how to do so. Ron suggested several good ideas to approach this problem. We know that we see patterning for 
     circular holes. What we could do is gradually expand circular holes to rectangles by increasing the exponent "p" of x^p + y^p = r^p. 
     There will be a competition between global and local buckling and by varying the exponent we can see how this transition occurs.
     Secondly we could set up an simple analytical model that is able to describe the this gradual process of local to global buckling. What
     this analytical model entails is still a bit vague, but it definitely will provide more insight in why and when what type of buckling 
     occurs.
 - Out of the two options the second one is the route we will take. It does mean that we take quite a large intermediate step in the entire
   thesis (what we didn't anticipate beforehand). But it does give us the most understanding of what we actually see. 
 - What to do after my holiday:
  - work on exponent-approach and read on analytical models in the book Ondrej sends me.
