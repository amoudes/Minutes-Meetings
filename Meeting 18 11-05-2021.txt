DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks last week:
 - Resolve numerical issues:
  - NOT DONE	- small-big-small errors - Will not focus on this problem since simulations will be done on infinite 
		  strip from now on. If it shows up in the infinite strip I will then try to answer it.
  - DONE 	- bump in linear DNS simulation - Reason is transition from local to global buckling (snap)

 DONE		- Investigate why the FE2 gives smaller error than MM
   		  Not sure what the problem is yet. Simulations using the same dimensions either.

 NOT DONE	- Adapt codes for infinite strip:
                 - Adapt DNS - change solver type to Newton
		 - FE2       - include macroscopic bifurcation analysis
                 - MM        - change solver type to Newton + include macroscopic bifurcation analysis

 		 Q - RUN_DNS_compression - line 39 - What is the function of 'TargetStretch'?

		 Q - solve_rC - What is B?

		 Q - solve_rC - Why is the gradient computed using grad_hess and not using grad_hess_c?
                	       Probably due to extended Hessian and Gradient (EH & EG).
 
 		 Q - get_rve_data - What is the difference between Cpbc and Ccon?
                	          - Tying matrix: What are the components IC, JC and SC?

 NOT DONE	- Analyse infinite strip
 		 - Implement and run simulations using for new variables
   		 - Square holes
   		 - Variable hole size (circular / square)

 DONE		- Change presentation according to comments
 
 NOT DONE	- Determine critical buckling load
