DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks last week:
 - Resolve numerical issues:
  - NOT DONE	- small-big-small errors - Will not focus on this problem since simulations will be done on infinite 
		  strip from now on. If it shows up in the infinite strip I will then try to answer it.
  - DONE 	- bump in linear DNS simulation - Reason is transition from local to global buckling (snap)

 DONE		- Investigate why the FE2 gives smaller error than MM
   		  Not sure what the problem is yet, larger dimensions MM Newton algorithm does not converge.

 NOT DONE	- Adapt codes for infinite strip:
                 - Adapt DNS - change solver type to Newton
		 - FE2       - include macroscopic bifurcation analysis
                 - MM        - change solver type to Newton + include macroscopic bifurcation analysis

 		 Q - RUN_DNS_compression - line 39 - What is the function of 'TargetStretch'?

		 Q - solve_rC - What is B?

		 Q - solve_rC - Why is the gradient computed using grad_hess and not using grad_hess_c?
                	       Probably due to extended Hessian and Gradient (EH & EG).
 
 		 Q - get_rve_data - What is the difference between Cpbc and Ccon?
                	          - Tying matrix: What are the components IC, JC and SC?

		 Q - How is 

 NOT DONE	- Analyse infinite strip
 		 - Implement and run simulations using for new variables
   		 - Square holes
   		 - Variable hole size (circular / square)

 DONE		- Change presentation according to comments
 
 NOT DONE	- Determine critical buckling load

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Smaller FE2 error than MM:
 - From the results of the FE2 and MM simulations we can conclude that there are no bugs/problems with the MM code. The
   larger MM in the 2x3 case can be explained by the discretization. Although using similar defailt input values as in the 
   paper (40x40) did not result in converged MM simulations, the FE2 error was significantly larger than the MM. 
    - In the following, before running the D2 sweep on the infinite strip, I will do a similar analysis to rule out any
      errors problems beforehand.
    - The MM error between Q8 (9.07%) and T9 (8.71%) elements is very small. To have a computationally more favourable
      simulation it is wise to opt for the faster elements with less integration points, this being the Q8 elements.

Adapt code for inifinite strip:
 - There are various options of implementing PBC. We discussed two methods in detail and one briefly.
   1) Using Lagrange multiplieres: Here you list all displacements in the C matrix and equate them to zero (rhs, B = 0).
      See the meeting notes for more detail. This method makes use of an extended Hessian (EH) matrix and Gradient (EG)
      vector. Currently 'solve_rC' makes use of this method. 
      The difficulty of this problem is the compuation of eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix (K), since you minimize 
      the energy and maximize with respect to Lagrange multipliers you have a min-max problem (saddlepoint) and therefore 
      you will always find negative eigenavalues. Bifurcation analysis using this method therefore requires a different 
      approach than is currently implemented. It is possible using null-space projection which is not currently implemented 
      in the code. Ondrej will do this later today.
   2) Condensation. Displacements are separated into two; one part describes dependent nodes. They are linked to the 
      independent nodes on the other side of the vertical boundary. The benefit of this method is that by condensation linked
      information is stored in the C matrix. When computing the stiffness matrix later therefore is easier since you are only
      considering a minimzation problem (as opposed to a min/max problem with Lagrange multipliers), therefore minDiag function
      works nicely here.
   3) Direct assembly of the stiffness matrix. Here you make use of the linked nodes and assign a spring like stiffness around
      the nodes and penalize displacements. More info is not required since we will focuss on methods 1) or 2).
 - For proper functionality of the code it is important to stay consistent in the approach we take. Solver and determination
   of the Hessian all rely on the method chosen.
 - We changed the condensation approach in the DNS to the Lagrange approach to stay consistent with the 'solve_rC' solver.
   The solver seemed to work fine. Problems however arose in the macroscopic bifurcation analysis. The current Hessian
   construction does not enforce the periodicity constraints therefore it is not able to find a correct link up between the two
   vertical boundaries. It is remains stuck in the halving-time-step loop. I should replace 'grad_hess' with 'grad_hess_c'
   that uses a condensed matrix.
 - For the MM and FE2 the problem is a bit more complex. They both use Lagrange multipliers for tying PBC and therefore I
   should use the null-space projection method that Ondrej will Implement soon.
