NOTES MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - reconstruct 4x4 MM and FE2. Run it both on original code and altered code. and see what the problem is with 
 - tasks next week check numerical errors, soon failure, peek in DNS
 - change in microstructures
  - different hole size in RVE
  - periodicity infinite horizontally specimen from now
  - square holes (allows orientation)
 - Change presentation according to comments

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Mesh convergence study on MM and DNS is helpful. hmax of 0.167 is indeed a suitable maximum mesh size parameter. A few
   Comments about the mesh convergence study:
   - In the MM and DNS comparison plot you can distinguish two types of errors: 1) discretization error - This is due to 
     the discretization of the mesh. The results should flatten out upon mesh refinement. 2) DBC edge error / error due to 
     size effects - this is due to the fact the DBC introduce some artificial stiffness in the specimen. When more holes 
     are introduced in the macro domain the error between DNS and MM should decrease.
   - hmax is not perfectly reflected back in the mesh but is a good mesh size tuning parameter nontheless.
 - The results of the D2 sweep of the MM, FE2 and DNS is done okay. Some remarks:
   - Kinematically it appears that MM is much more accurate than the FE2. The MM is much more capable to capture the
     DNS deformation.
   - In terms of error the opposite effect is seen when regarding the results of the a constant hole diameter throughout
     the sample. The error for FE2 is smaller then for MM which actually should not be the case considering previous
     research. I should test MM and FE2 on the same 2x2 square stacking of holes on my altered code and original code to
     see where the problem lies. If I can not find the problem I should contact Ondrej.
   - There are two numerical issues I should investigate
     1) A bump in the linear DNS simulation for D2 ~ 0.6 - F.e. use Paraview to check deformation evolution
     2) The small-big-small cases of the MM simulations do not completely finish. I should check the log for errors/warnings.
        I can play with the time discretization steps and the bifurcation pertubation size (either too big or not enough steps).
   - When the issues are resolved I can go and run the simulations in a smaller region of interest. Kinematically speaking,
     the region lies is about [0.78 - 0.85], though this region does give larger errors than smaller regions.
   - Logical next step is to only consider the horizontally infinite strip. a 2x12 strip can be used to prevent global
     which requires the same computational power both for DNS, FE2 and MM.
   - Also I can start to think about other variable features. (square holes, variable hole size within RVE).
   - Non-perfect allingment of holes we consider not necessary and difficult to test. With a sufficient large offset we would
     go to the hexagonal stacking which is more complicated (3 patterning modes instead of 1). Therefore we avoid it.
 - Overall structure of the presentation is okay. Some remarks:
   - In motivation mention the coupled buckling optimization earlier. This is clearly a spearpoint of the project and should
     be clear in the beginning.
   - Structure after that is fine. Explanation of the MM is okay and maybe emphasize again on the multi-scale buckling. 
   - The project structure could be presented more clearly. Instead of a linear path I can use a V-shaped path from computational
     homogenization to parametric design or topology optimization.
   - Challanges listed currently only exist for the topology optimization and should therefore move to that section.
   - The goal of the parametric desing is to perform multi-scale topology optimization using the MM scheme (not TO). Verifies
     the possibility of the redistribution of the period.
   - TO part of the project is still vague. Present the general idea of this part that follows from the challange at hand
     and also mention that what we are actually planning in this part is still up for debate.

TASK THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Investigate why the FE2 gives smaller error than MM - Not sure what the problem is yet. Simulations using the same
                                                         dimensions either.
 - Resolve numerical issues:
   - small-big-small errors - Will not focus on this problem since simulations will be done on infinite strip from now on.
			      If it shows up in the infinite strip I will then try to answer it.
   x bump in linear DNS simulation - Reason is transition from local to global buckling (snap)
 - Adapt codes for infinite strip
 - Implement and run simulations using for new variables
   - Square holes
   - Variable hole size (circular / square)
 x Change presentation according to comments
 - Determine critical buckling load
