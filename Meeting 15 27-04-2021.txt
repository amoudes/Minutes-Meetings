DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Items last week:
 DONE      Made small corrections to MM script

 NOT DONE  Verification steps (energy & convergence rate)

 DONE      Learned bash script to execute programs on cluster
	   Q - How to save matlab command window in the cluster?
           Q - How to set PATH to subfolder? Currently when I execute .pbs file in subfolder gmsh commands are not 
               recognized. Therefore only running code in main hole_sheet_model folder a.t.m. and parallel not
               possible because of shared gmsh folder.
	   Explain setup with while-loop and sleep function.

 DONE      Started on the set up of limitation experiments
	   - Performed DNS simulations on fixed bigger hole (D1) and variable smaller hole D2
           - Currently running MM on same hole sizes

	   Q - Difficulties analyzing results. Would be good to discuss suitable field to work in for MM code.

	   Q - Analysis thus far have been performed on finite strip. Should I move on to infinite strip?

 DONE      Check whether FE2 switch works in MM script.
	   Discuss FE2 results.	

           Q - FE2 switch does not result in v1 ~ 0 field. One corner is significantly larger than 0 under default
               input settings. How come?

NOTES MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Change nr Gauss points from 6 to 3.
 - Tasks for next week:
  - include kinematic plots for next week's presentation
  - Sticking D1 is okay, and keep D2 variable. I can change D1 a bit to see what small differences make.
  - mesh convergence study
  - mesh density compatibility
  - prepare presentation before Friday
  - var. hole size within RVE

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster
 - First we discussed how things went running simulations on the cluster. Discussed my problems and how I solved it.
   Problem with gmsh in subfolders is most likely due to inability of Matlab to create a folder named gmsh and not the PATH
   to gmsh since that is added to the environment variables. I will try to run it again with subfolders and see whether
   this works.
 - Some tips about using 'enters' and submit stuff in bash. Appearantly the 'enter' command may give some problems and I
   should be carefull with using it. Use an alternative (forgot name) to use it instead.
 - Diary functions of Matlab command window can be found in the log file of in the same folder. No need to use 'diary on'
   in Matlab.

Limitation experiments
 - We will base the working range of the MM script on the error of the MM code compared to the DNS simulations.
 - To avoid global buckling we will after current simulations, run simulations using a infinite macroscopic geometry.
   For linear cases infinite will only be in horizontal direction - for periodic case infinite will be both vertically
   and horizontally.
 - I did not show plots of meshes. So it was difficult to base conclusions on the stress and energy only. I should 
   include deformation of macroscopic mesh on top of DNS simulation to see whether there are discrepansies.
 - Currently the amount of Gauss integration points in quadratic triangular elements is 6. I can safely change this 
   to 3. This will shave of computational time. Do a comparison simulation to check the effects and whether the 
   difference in results is significant.
 - It is okay for me to stick to a fixed large hole size (D1) and vary the smaller hole size. I can still do a few
   simulations with other large holesizes (D1 = 0.9 / 0.95 ) to check the effect.
 - The mesh density of the DNS and the RVE in the MM should be comparible. Ideally I should perform a mesh convergence
   study on the MM and DNS to check what should be a suitable mesh size. This is however computationally quite
   expensive. As the mesh convergence study was already performed in a previous paper I do not have to do it again.
   It might still be smart to do so.

FE2
 - A simple switch in the MM code still gives a non-zero v1 field. Including the switch is not as easy as expected.
   I will instead make use of the dedicated FE2 script from now on.

Meeting Ole Sigmund
 - Earliest possible meeting with Ole Sigmund would be on April 30th. I should make sure that before that date I
   have a presentation ready detailing the goal, set-up, challenges of the project. This has the hightest priority
   a.t.m.

TASK THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitation experiments
 - Continue running simulations on the MM code
 - Refine post processing. Include kinematic plots
 - Perform mesh convergence study on DNS and MM RVE.
 - For comparison run limitation experiments on FE2 scripts
  - Adapt FE2 script s.t. it allows variable RVEs
 - Implement variable hole size in an RVE
 - Implement  and run non perfect hole allignment in RVE and DNS

Meeting Ole Sigmund
 - Prepare presentation before Friday.
