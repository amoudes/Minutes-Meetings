DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Items last week:
 - Set up limitation experiments
  - Variable hole diameter DNS simulation 
    DONE - Succesfully managed to do this. I am able to run a DNS simulation for various hole diamters.
    
    Q    - No information about deformation is included (MM) therefore deformation can seem a bit off. How do you 
           know this DNS simulatin is actually correct?

  - Variable hole diameter in MM code
    DONE- I made sure that I construct a mesh for each RVE and solve it accordingly. I made use of a cell structure.
           In the DATA structure each RVE is assigned to its own cell. I can make linear, periodic and constant hole
           diameters.
           SHOW RESULTS and DISCUSS IMPLEMENTATION.

    Q    - How do you make sure that MM code perfectly matches the DNS simulation? (Hole locations)

    Q    - For other than constant diameter gmsh still gives unstable m-solver messages for each RVE in the first
           step. Any idea why?

    Q    - Difficult to plot individual results such as, mesh, forces, stresses, displacements.

  - Include switch in MM code to FE2.
    NOT DONE - Suggested to include a switch that empties constraint matrix: C = []. I thinks it should include the
               periodic boundary conditions, i.e. C = Cpbc.

    Q        - How to include switch to FE2?
               Described method gives lots of warning messages.


 - Comparison with DNS, through P22 or displacement, reaction force. 
   NOT DONE - Not enough time

 - Analytical solution check
   NOT DONE - Not enough time

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Items this week
 - Cluster tutorial
 - Discuss results last week
 - Validation results

 - Move meeting to another time

Comments meeting
 - Use shape functions N instead of tcoord in obtaining Gauss coordinates.
 - check code by evaluating energies and forces using finite differences.
  - another check - measure rate of convergence of Newton solver
 - Compare MM variable hole diameter with DNS or FE2.
 - DNS: run_fluctioations_circles_regular.m
 - experiment with cluster with simple examples
 - look at git4bash
 - Compare examples I ran with DNS, kinematics
 - Try gradual change in diameter
 - Set up validation method with DNS

SUMMARY MEETING

 - Ondrej's previous meeting ran out again so we decided to change the weekly meeting to a different timeslot: 
   TUE 16:00-17:00
 - We first discussed progress of last week. What I did and my questions.
   Overall pleased to see that implementation of varying hole diameter was successful.
   Comments code:
    - Instead of using tcoord, I should use shape functions N to obtain Gauss point coordinates. tcoord works okay for these
      elements but if we want to make it more generic and use different elements, tcoords might give trouble. Therefore I 
      should use N.
    - Also I can consider to make sure that other RVE types also work with the current code so that when I would like to try
      different elements it works.
    - Two checks I could do to check correct workings of code would be:
       A) Check energy and forces by means of finite differences. Use the grad_hess function.
       B) Check quadratic convergence of Newton solver by log-log plot of the residual. If slope = 2 then correct.
      These methods provide handles to check correct working of code.
 - We fixed the FE2 part of the code hopefully by including by including Cv in the constraints matrix C (prevents rigid body
   modes). Initial results look promising. Micromorphic parts of fe and u are zero.
   I should still check whether it actually works as intended.
 - I can move on to work towards real limitation testing of the MM code. I can do this by checking which diameters work well
   with the MM code.
   Comparisons should be made directly to the DNS script which will be the RUN_simple.m script. This needs a bit of tweaking
   still such that it buckles locally instead of globally. To do this I should find a macrosopic geometry that is less
   slender and thicker. DNS functions as "real" solution.

   FE2 and MM script can be compared with DNS. Use P22 component rather than kinematics.
 - Second part of the meeting was focussed on the cluster tutorial. It took quite a while to get it to work.
   From now on I can use the cluster to run large simulations in the background. I should read the manual before doing so
   just to be sure.
   Cluster uses bash and git for code. I should read up on bash to get familiar with coding.
