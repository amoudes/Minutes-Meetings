NOTES MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Run DNS try find some patterning mode where patterning is in competition with FE2
 - Run L1 L2 on the MM. (just to see what it does).
 - Patterning mode analysis on the RVE. include them in MM and maybe include 3 modes.

 - Shear in two possible places, (i) patterning mode option, (ii) deformation gradient.

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Shown results of the microstructures of the DNS are in line with what we discussed last week. I had a questions about orientation of the
   rectangular holes and what was correct. Right now I keep the horizontal edge of the void horizontal and tilt the vertical edges to adjust
   to the predetermined shape. This means that we are able to introduce another variable to the meshes being (i) the angle for linear cases,
   and (ii) period, max deviation and phase for the periodic cases.
 - We also discussed the results of the height and width study of the rectangular holes without angles/orientation. What Ondrej did not
   expect was that no patterning mode could be distinguised in the microstructure. Upon bifurcation the system buckled mostly globally.
 - The lack of any deformation patterns in the microstructure (apart from shearing pattern) will make it difficult (if not impossible) to 
   capture this using the MM scheme since holes are able to communicate with each other via the patterning mode fields (vi). Since we do not
   observe any patterning in the current DNS deformations the vi fields will most likely be ~0 and thus the MM will be limited to FE2.
 - The shearing modes suggest that the second order FE2 is required to capture the shearing effects. This would be a big change to the MM 
   scheme as it is currently and might lie beyond the scope of this project.
 - Intuitively you could introduce a shearing mode as a patterning mode into the MM scheme. The problem however is that (1) shear then can
   originate from the patterning mode AND the deformation gradient. Thus creating a non-uniqueness in your solution. (2) Patterning modes 
   are defined using four control nodes that are stationary upon applying the patterning mode deformation. In shear some of these points are
   not stationary. A solution for (2) would be to introduce second order FE2, but as already mentioned that would drastically change the code,
   take quite some time to implement and be quite difficult.
 - Other observations:
   - For wide horizontal struts there is little communication between vertical elements. Hence buckling between rows is random. When
     horizontal strut thickness decreases struts are buckling between rows is affected by each other and longest buckling period is most
     common buckling shape.
   - For thick vertical struts the same principle applies. No deformation communication between columns. When decreasing strut thickness this
     becomes much more dominant.
   - Small holes render a too stiff specimen to buckle at 5% compression using current input settings.
 - Thus what we would like to see is some pattering in the microstructure in the DNS simulations. If we see a pattern we can designa a
   pattering mode and thus we can the MM scheme. Using the current orientation of the holes we do not see patterning. One way to find one is
   to orient the holes or revert back to circular holes that have shown that a patterning mode does occur when compressing.
 - How to implement an oriented vertical ligament in the MM scheme was another topic for discussion. One what to do this was to apply some
   rotation matrix to the RVE (which it already does basically) and then compute the deformations etc. Another approach would be to change the
   RVE shape such that it allows slanted vertical struts. We do not have to be limited to square RVEs. What should be guaranteed is periodicity
   between RVEs.
 - The deformation mode we saw that occured for a rectangular hole in FE2 lied was a random buckling direction. The longest possible wavelength 
   corresponds to the longest buckling mode in an RVE and not of the macrostructure since there is not connection between individual RVEs.
 - Another approach for finding a pattern would be to perform an eigenvalue test using the RVE_F function already implemented in the develop
   branch. This is also the approach taken to find the patterning mode of the square stacking of holes. Similar approach can be taken to find
   a patterning mode for rectangular holes (oriented, slanted, etc.).

TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Run width & height (L1,L2) simulations on MM scheme
  (see what it does and test whether the MM is able to pick up the deformation mode of the RVEs - probably not though)

 - RUN DNS for various hole shapes, ligament orientations, L1-L2 combinations to see whether a pattern can be distinguished

 - Perform patterning mode analysis on the RVE. If possible deformation modes are found include them in the MM scheme (3 modes or so).
