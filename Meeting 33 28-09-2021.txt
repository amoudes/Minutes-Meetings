SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frame model
 - The frame model using the condensation method for horizontal and vertical periodicity works well and indeed shows good periodicity.
 - I had a few questions still about the lack of a transition region. The reason for a lack of transition reagon is that the LBA only takes
   into account the lowest eigenvalue and corresponding mode. This means that only one will show up in the LBA and a combination is not
   possible. What I can do to gain more insight in the how the eigenvalues behave with the thickness ratio is to plot both eigenvalues as a
   function of thickness ratio.
 - To get a better comparison between the DNS and the frame model I should use similar input values. I can obtain the Young's modulus through
   previously set up equations in Ondrej's notes.
 - Also to get a better comparison I should rethink the cross and how the cross shaped hole behaves. To be very neat I should maintain similar
   material density throughout when making comparisons. Though this is not perfectly clear to me yet.
 
Condensation to three important components
 - We consider the most simple representation of the system to be the a single column with lateral and rotational springs on the two ends. 
 - What we aim to do with the 2x2 frame model is to find values for the spring stiffnesses.
 - To find the values what we need to do is to condense the entire stiffness matrix into single variables that correspond to the horizontal
   vertical and rotational spring stiffnesses.
 - This condensation takes place after partitioning of the boundary conditions and after condensation of the periodic nodes. Thus at the very
   end. So I need to take into account the remapping of the nodes from the original configuration to the condensed out configuration.
 - The nodes we are interested in is the central node in the frame. So the junction of the vertical and horizontal ligament.
 - As a sanity check I could also check the joint nodes at the edges, they should have the same value as the central node.
 - Hopefully what we will see is that when we have prismatic (uniform) beams we have values of the springs stiffnesses that we can also obtain
   from analytical equations. This will suggest that the 2x2 model can be approximated using the simple beam column model.
 - Furthermore we hope to find that under prismatic conditions we see that the rotational stiffness is four times the translational stiffness.
 - We can hopefully relate the values of the stiffnesses back to what we know and see in the deformed configurations. I should take into
   account that I have to make a fair comparison between the deformed deformed configurations. So equal displacements.
 - If I condense out to the three relevant stiffnesses I will obtain a 3x3 matrix where the components will most likely be coupled. To avoid
   this I could condense down to just 1 parameter.

Presentation
 - Overall Ondrej was quite positive about the presentation. He had a few comments though:
  - Leave out the techniqualities of TO. Mention it briefly as a possible way of designing the microstructure
  - Elaborate more on the design freedom we have. That I ran a lot of simulations to test how far we could push the micromorphic model
  - Include the analytical model in future steps.
