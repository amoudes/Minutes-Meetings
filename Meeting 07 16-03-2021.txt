Attending: 
 Thijs Oudes
 Ondrej Rokos

DISCUSSION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Points last week:
 - Research plan
  - Sufficiently detailed?
     - More emphasis on patterning mode optimization in part II

 - Planning
  - Evaluate planning
  - What to do with Part III?


 - Background information
  - Rewriting parts
  - Curly brackets p4-p5?
  - p3 comment about continuity


Tasks this week
 - Meeting with Ron
 - Finishing report
  - Working through comments Ondrej

multiscale - asymptotic expansion comment
we dropped part IV so multiscale does not have to be that elaborate

problem definition - explain importance of patterning modes well

SUMMARY MEETING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Research plan
  - Part IV will be considered too much work for this project. Therefore, only Parts I-III will be considered
  - The novelty in our project will be the optimization for the patterning mode. As far as we know this has not been
    done before.
  - Part III is nice to include as an end goal but should not be considered an absolute requirement for the project.
    Therefore the multiscale aspect of the project is reduced to investigating the patterning modes and would be a 
    good follow-up project.
  - The multiscale framework already exists and therefore Part III is not the main interest of the project.

 - Project planning
  - Since optimizing the microstructure for the patterning mode will be the "core" of the project I should reserve a
    bit more time for that in the project planning
  - Right now I reserverd time for report writing at the end of the entire project. I should disperse is more
    throughout the project. It makes sense to write sections when it is fresh in my mind.

 - Further comments
  - I will be able to finish the report this week. I will send a draft to Ondrej preferably on Thursday and Friday
    latest.
  - Next week Tuesday I will have a meeting with Ondrej and Ron to talk about the preparation report and goals. If
    all is well I should be able to start with the project next week Tuesday (23-03).

TASKS THIS WEEK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Finish the preparation report on Thursday
  - Work through Ondrej's comments
  - Write introduction part
  - Rewrite multiscale analysis (though briefly)
  - Rephrase problem statement. Highlight the emphasis on patterning modes
