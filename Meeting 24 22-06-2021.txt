DISCUSSION

DONE		- Run width & height (L1,L2) simulations on MM scheme

IN PROGRESS	- RUN DNS for various hole shapes, ligament orientations, L1-L2 combinations to see whether a pattern can be distinguished

IN PROGRESS	- Perform patterning mode analysis on the RVE. If possible deformation modes are found include them in the MM scheme (3 modes or so).

 - Meeting Ron on Friday
 - Planning during summer period
 - Recap/feedback up to now

NOTES MEETING

 - relax periodicity MM and FE2
   (see if same problems pop up here as well)
 - prepare presenation for friday

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 - Meeting started off with discussing the rectangular hole study using FE2 and MM. There was a slight confusion about the RVEs and control
   points. RVE showed shear behaviour and Ondrej interpreted it as a patterning mode which would not be possible since a patterning mode 
   contains four fixed control points. This was cleared up relatively quickly.
 - Results of the rectangular FE2 study showed that the longest buckling period is that of the RVE. No communication between cells exist
   hence when RVEs are compliant enough they buckle randomly. Compared to DNS there is no real global buckling direction.
 - There was a minor comment about one of the DNS simulations. It was not able to continue through the bifurcation analysis. In the log file
   it had something to do with halving the time step. Something to remember for the future and not a pressing issue at the moment.
 - The rectangular hole study on the MM code showed only FE2 results. The v1 fields were zero in all cases, meaning that the patterning mode
   has not been triggered for and the MM resorts back to the FE2 simulations.
 - As for microstructural inspiration: Ondrej sent me a few papers that showed some microstructures that followed from multiscale concurrent
   topology optimization. They are in line with what we have been implementing thus far and can be a good source of inspiration to test
   different microstructures than just square holes or circles.
 - The pattern study on the DNS is performed to see whether any pattern would show up in the DNS that we could describe using an analytical
   expression or using linearized buckling analaysis. Unfortunately using the angled vertical strut we did not see any patterns in the micro-
   structure. We had hoped to see a similar buckling pattern like the ciruclar holes but then for the rectangular holes. Unfortunately we did
   not.
 - We did see some localization in the bottom row of holes which is not something we should expect. Upon closer inspection it seems that the
   angle of the vertical struts is a bit different (a bit more compliant) thus creating a weak row in the overall mesh. I should inspect this 
   in the future.
 - Periodic tests using half a period and a full period showed that upon buckling the structure follows the shape of the altered mesh. There
   should be a competition between the global buckling and the higher order prescribed buckling mode but it does not show up in the deformed
   meshes.
(- side comment: in the future I should make sure that the figures I use in the presentation are a bit more clear and intuitive. I have had a
   few times that Ondrej did not understand initially the figures he was looking at.)
 - The circular hole shapes did show a patterning upond deformation before global buckling. Even as far as that the patterning is able to
   progress throughout the specimen under a small angle and small amplitude.
 - Linearized buckling analysis on the RVEs showed that for most cases the RVE would buckle in a buckling pattern and some cases the primary
   buckling mode would be global buckling.
 - Including two patterning modes in the MM model also did not give positive v1 and v2 fields. I included two patterning modes based on the
   linearized buckling analysis on the RVE. The MM was not able to pick up the patterns and the v1 and v2 fields were both zero.
 - This poses a problem. We would want to have patterning mode in the RVE using square holes such that the MM is able to kick in. Though with
   the current simulations we do not see any. Also DNS does not show any patterning using square holes.
 - What we could do is relieve the periodicity of the FE2 and MM. If we see global buckling occuring in these simulations (using square holes)
   it would mean that the random buckling direction is an artefact of the horizontal infinite specimen. We could then proceed by stating that
   under semi-infinite conditions the MM and FE2 do not work properly. I should also perform DNS simulations using finite specimens to verify
   any patterning.
 - Another approach could be that we would have to include second order continuum in the MM scheme so that bending is incorporated and we could
   relieve some of the control points. This is not the prefered option as it would lead to a drastically more complicated code and much more
   work. 
 - What route to take we will discuss Friday in the meeting with Ron. He might also have some good ideas.
 - For the meeting with Ron, I should prepare a few slides summarizing what we have been doing up to now.

 - I also asked for some feedback on the progress of the project overall from Ondrej. He is overall pretty happy with how things are going. I
   show that I am able to work independently and need little help. In terms of progress he is happy as well. The project is not as well
   defined as other projects and we shape the road we take along the way making it sometimes a bit vague of what we should do. But still he is
   pretty happy where things are right now.
