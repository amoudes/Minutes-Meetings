SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - We started off by discussing my problems of making a fair comparison between the frame model and the analytical/single column model for
   where we know that the solution is correct. One approach Ondrej suggested to test whether the frame model is to cancel the thickness and 
   Young's modulus for the horizontal ligaments and compress accordingly. We should see the second order buckling mode popping up due to 
   the periodicity constraints. The corresponding critical buckling force should correspond with the second order buckling of the single
   column model.
 - Next we discussed the discrepansie between the critical bucklinkg forces when compressing the frame model. It seems that the critical
   buckling force was dependend on the force P we put in. Also I might mix something up with the direction of the force since I obtain
   negative eigenvalues indiciating that we should pull on it to get to the buckling mode. In any case we fixed the problem of the dependency
   of the force during the meeting. I applied the force horizontally intead of vertically. The deformed configuration looks to be okay and
   behave as we would expect.
   - We also dived a bit deeper in the computation of the eigenvalues and what the values actually mean. 
   - To study the effects of the normal forces in the beams elements I should plot the value of the normal forces in the mesh using some color
     coding. e.g. red for compression and blue for tension. We would do this to see where compression and tension arise in the frame and on 
     places where we would expect them to. Which would lead to see what the effects of the geometric stiffness matrix are.
 - Last we discussed teh connection of the frame model to the single column model. Yesterday Ron made a suggestion about using an L-bracket
   instead of using springs to model the connecting ligaments. We though about it but it seems not possible to do it this way. The problem 
   lies in applying the boundary conditions. Using boundary conditions we can either obtain one of the two buckling modes:
   - symmetry conditions: local buckling
   - periodic conditions: global buckling
   hence one model that encompasses both buckling modes is in what we think not possible. Therefore we resort to the model with springs.
 - To proof the concept of springs to Ron I could run the model using a variety of combinations of springs stiffnesses to see if it is
   indeed possible to obtain local and global buckling just by varying the ratio between the stiffnesses. We brainstormed on the type of 
   deformations we would expect from the single column model and we should clearly be able to obtain local and global buckling. Though a 
   third buckling mode also comes into play judging from the ratio-lambda study I performed on the frame model.
 - For the condensation of the frame model; I can continue on this front as well. I will have to pick the left middle node as this will
   best correspond the situation of the single column model (fixed x-y bottom, rot. springs top & bottom, translational spring top). I can
   use the values from the static condensation in the single column model and compute the eigenvalues. The critical buckling forces should
   be in the same order of magnitude with hopefully max ~10% error.
 - I should also proceed with the static condensation and the engineering method of obtaining the stiffness value. We saw before that these
   values should have very small differences.
