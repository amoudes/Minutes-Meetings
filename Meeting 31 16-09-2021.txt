SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - This meeting was the first meeting in a while together with Ron. We started by summarizing the point where we left off three weeks ago.
   I summarized what we had done previously and answered questions Ron had after our previous meeting.
 - This meeting was one of the important meetings we have had up to now since we discussed and decided what direction we would like to take 
   the thesis and what the core of the thesis would be about. More on this later.
 - First of all we briefly discussed the type of deformation we see for the repeating RVE. The enlarged image of the microstructure of the
   DNS simulation with square holes indeed showed what we already suspected. That the major bending moments in the square hole array are
   found at the quarter and three quarter points of the ligaments (and not at the junctions).
 - The next step we took was the approximation of circular holes by dividing each ligament up into four segments and changing varying the
   thickness ratio between ligaments. Effectively we would model cross shaped holes. I ran simulations for the transition from uniform to
   high thickness ratio and indeed we saw the same type of transition from global to local buckling as for continuous holes.
   - side comment: I should be careful with meshing. R = 1 and R = 2.7 have different mesh densities which could lead to differences in
     simulation results. So if we would do it more neatly I should keep the mesh density roughly equal.
   Ron was pleased to see that the results we obtained are in line with the hypothesis we posed in the previous meeting. By increasing the 
   thickness ratio we are able to relocate the position of the major bending moment towards the center of the ligament, eventually resulting
   in local buckling pattern.
 - Where it comes to the simplified single column model I did make some mistakes in my assumptions when it comes to the number of stackes
   cells and the applied boundary conditions.
   - Stacking of cells. As we have already seen it is not possible to capture both global and local buckling with the stacking of two cells.
     In fact what we are for is the bending behaviour of a single cell. If we think about it the stacking of two cells is too much.
   - Boundary conditions. The two problems go hand-in-hand. In order to capture the global buckling we would actually need to model only one
     ligament and only the moment at the top edge. This would allow us to get a shear typ deformation and thus a bending mode with two major
     bending moments in the ligament.
   Thus I'll have to reperform the simulations on the unit cells using these boundary conditions and geometry. It was argued during the 
   meeting that we will still not be able to capture the transition and that will still need some kind of horizontal stiffness/moment at to 
   capture local buckling, but it is still worth trying.
 - The results that we had for the single column analysis were for these reasons not discussed in detail.
 - The discussion followed on what type of boundary conditions we would need for a single column to show both global and local buckling. We
   could for example enforce zero bending halfway through and at the top and bottom, but this would result in the prevention of global
   buckling. In short what we concluded is that the horizontal ligaments are most needed for both global and local buckling.
 - This allowed us to proceed to the frame LBA. Ron was actually quite pleased to see that this had been done as well and also in a proper
   manner. It was good that we are able to see both global and local buckling depending on the thickness ratio. Ron however argued that the
   boundary layer effects actually prevent the model from actually showing real global buckling. The same type of boundary conditions we
   would want to enforce on the single column should be applied here as well. Meaning that we would actually need vertical periodicity as
   well.
   - A quick way of validation would be to perform horizontal and vertical periodicity analysis on 2x2 periodic elements for square and
     circular holes. For circular holes we would see the patterning mode popping op and for square holes we should see the shear mode.
   - The frame model should behave similarly.

 - The discussion that followed was about how to proceed next with the project. With the time we still have we had to make a decision on
   what we would like to focuss on. As Ondrej put it, we have two paths we could take. 1) Continue with our study on global to local buckling
   and really to understand the transition. 2) Try to implement our current findings in the MM model and find a way to capture it using 
   patterning modes or higher order FE2.
   As I see it in order to do 2) you need a good understanding of 1). Ron agreed on this and was more enthusiastic about option 1). It has
   the potential to be published. And there are numerous things we could still investigate with option 1), for example partial global and 
   partial local buckling patterns in one microstructure. For this reason we decided to continue working on option 1), thereby redetermining
   the goal of the project and dropping the topology optimization part of the thesis.
 - The last part was about the potential of the project to be published, and the choice I have for writing my report in general report style
   or in the style of a draft paper such it has the possiblity to be published. Either choice has its benefits but I have to decide on time
   since it requires some time and dedication to write it in one form.
   I decided that I will not make a decision at the moment but in a few weeks after I see how things are going. My preference at the moment 
   lies at writing a draft paper.
 - Lastly we scheduled my mid-term presentation on the 4th of October.
