                      very large t/T ratios.

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The general topic of the meeting was 1) discussing the set up of the FE code and 2) analysing the results of the code.

 - We also briefly discussed the inclusion of a horizontal spring to the single column and confirmed the effect it had on the overal
   buckling more. It was in line with the theory I found in literature.

 Code run through:
 - In the first part we walked through the code in search for any inconsistensies, problems or errors. Ondrej commented that the general
   structure is good with a few comments here and there.
 - The major comment he had was on how the geometric stiffness matrix (Kg) is constructed. I opted to use the method he also used in the
   RVE_F.m file, that cuts corners in its construction of Kg. Since he did not have an explicit expression for Kg he used first a small
   deformation to construct Kg. Since I do have an explicit expression for Kge it is more neat to use that. It also mitigates any potential
   errors that may stem from the less neat way of obtaining Kg.
  - What the new method entails is that I need to compute the normal forces in each element. I can do this by obtaining the strain in each
    element and than using the simple Hookean relation to obtain the normal force. I do have to take into account the transition between
    local and global coordinates.

 Results analysis:
 - We spent some more time on the analyzing the results.
 - Initially we saw that the frame did not behave as we would expect with ratio = 1. The vertical ligaments showed a higher order buckling
   mode than the big D shape. We believe this to be caused by the clamped boundary conditions. When we increase the vertical layer count the
   buckling mode indeed changes to a D shape. Also if we leviate the clamped to a pinned configuration the structure indeed buckles with a D
   shape.	-->	We can therefore conclude that the minimum required vertical layer should be large enough to mitigate the boundary
                        layer effect. Typically this should >= 4. (An even is required to allow patterning).
		-->     Horizontally the pattern repeats every 2 cells, therefore the not more than 2 horizontal copies are required. More 
           		only results in larger computational effort.
 - I found an error in the way thin and thick elements are assigned. I corrected it on the fly. It did change the results since only a small
   part of the frame now consists out of thick elements. It changes the overal buckling behaviour in that local patterning does not appear.
   It therefore also depends on the location of thicker elements. When changing the ratio I therefore also should make sure that the amount
   thick elements changes.
 - Since we need to take into account boundary layer effects, the original 2x2 representation of the RVE does not suffice anymore. As a
   consequence I will also have to change how the mesh is set up. Instead of modeling a junction of vertical and horizontal bars I will
   change to modeling a single hole and repeating this 2x horitonzally and 4x vertically.

 Status project, report writing, mid-term presentation
 - The end of the project starts to come in sight. Therefore we have to start to think about how to wrap up the project and have a nice
   conclusion. Right now it seems that the topology optimization part of the project is pushed to a follow up project and that this project
   revolves around extending the MM model s.t. it is able to treat more general microstructures. 
 - Next week Thursday we have a meeting with Ron. Here we will discuss the project status, next steps and good point of finalization. After
   that meeting we can schedule my mid-term presentation and how the report will be set up.
