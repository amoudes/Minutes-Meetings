DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions:
 Introduction:
	- what is the third comment in the abstract
	- abstract: comment on To validate this assumption
		- gain more insights (now it is relatively weak) frame it stronger.
 			1) gain insights in behaviour
			2) validite
			3) design principles


 Numerical study:
	- Representation of LBA study plots results

 Analytical model:
	- discuss mapping alpha to rho
	- Division by 2Fe, should it not be 4Fe?

 Application:
	- Discuss both models
	- How to formulate the improvement made



 Misc:
 - mention manufactering errors and mistakes

NOTES MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - run RVE line 343 for stress calculation
 - calculate reaction forces through: evaluation corner nodes
                                      unit force approach
 				      take into account the left corner node when summarizing

 - Argue in terms of stresses in terms of stresses. determine stresses instead of forces since we are dealing with RVEs
   Retcon: stay with Euler critical loads -> more intuititive mention that it can also be expressed in stresses

 - explain who limits at rho = 0.25 - rho  = 1
