SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Since last meeting was three days earlier we did not have that much to discuss. My main results were the linear buckling analysis on the
   straight beam. We saw that although the beam is able to change thickness for each segment we do not obtain a higher order buckling mode.
   Even for very large thick/thin beam ratios the beam still buckled globally (no S-shape). This leads us to believe that the horizontal bar
   definitely influences the buckling mode we observe. We need to introduce some lateral stiffness to the system to make sure the system
   buckles locally.
 - We discussed several ways to do so.
   1) Start off with horizontal springs alocated at the points of inflection (connection points between horizontal and vertical struts). This
      would be a quick study to verify the behaviour we would like to observe. Although Ron is not a big fan of this option, it would allow
      us to quickly verify our assumptions. Additionally, since we have the global stiffness matrix to our disposal, adding a horizontal
      stiffness at these points is not too difficult.
   2) Extend the existing model with horizontal columns. This requires more work since we have to think about the boundary conditions that we
      apply. Horitontally we enforce periodicity, which means that we need to make several copies of the horizontal-vertical junction. This
      will come close to our actual DNS simulation although it will provide us with much more information since we have the stiffness matrix
      to our disposal. We essentially know what goes into the system.
 - Later we discussed the techniqualities of setting up a FE model that is more complicated. In the simple model only a 4x4 Ke (element
   stiffness matrix) sufficed, however since we also need to include axial deformation now we introduce an additional DOF so we will need a
   6x6 Ke.
 - Since the model turns out to be more extensive than we anticipated, expressing the system in a set of analytical equations proves to be a
   not possible. The insight we gain by using the element stiffness matrix of beams is already sufficient for the system.
 - The single parameter that we change will be the thick/thin ratio of the beams.
 - The assembly of the global stiffness matrix of extended model will be more involved when we introduce more horizontal struts. This will
   mean I will have to look at where I place what in the global stiffness matrix. One good suggestion will be using a connectivity matrix to
   use that for the global assembly. I also have to pay attention to the change in angle of my elements. Lateral displacement of horizontal
   elements corresponds to axial displacement of vertical elements so I have to be carefull. A good option is to use a transformation matrix
   consiting of sin and cos terms to transform my beam elements to the desired orientation.

TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Extend the single column linear buckling analysis with springs at the hor-ver ligament junctions as a quick validation.
 - Extend the single column model with horizontal beams.
 - Set up a meeting with Ron in about two weeks.
