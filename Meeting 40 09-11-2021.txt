SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - We started the meeting off by discussing the possibilities for extendig the thesis for a few weeks. We ended up with the conclusion that 
   we would postpone the project by a few weeks. The presentation is set at Friday January 14th, and I will have to have the draft paper
   finished by December 23rd.
 - I decided that I will be writing a draft paper instead of a report. This is my prefered option. I have never written a paper before and
   it is a good opportunity for me to get some experience for that as well.
 - I will have to think about the structure of the paper and think of where I want to place certain elements
   Suggested structure by Ron:
   - Introduction
   - Numerics
   - Analytical derivations
   - Conclusion
   Actual structure and content may vary.
 - I decided that I will put the design space study into the appendix as it is not the core of the thesis and I the extent at which I tested
   the design space is not necessary to cover in the introduction.
 - We decided that I will set up a report structure and mail it to Ron and Ondrej by Thursday so that we can discuss it during our next
   meeting on Monday.
 
 Analytical model:
 - Overall Ron and Ondrej were quite pleased with the results of the energy approach. Although Ron was a bit surprised that the energy approach
   also lead to the derivation of the critical load, he could later understand where it was comming from. 
 - We discussed the source of the error of the local buckling pattern and from how I understood it, the error stemt from the comparison
   assumption of the deflected shape with added rigid parts.
   Other sources of the error we also discussed. In particular Ondrej thought that the error came from the linear approximation of the
   prescribed displacement of the rigid parts. I tested this and the decrease of error when using a higher order approximation was very
   small, if not negligeble.
 - Since the model is quite accurate we decided not to pursue higher accuracy. As Ron framed it: "It is not our goal to obtain an accurate
   model but to capture the mechanics."
   Capturing the mechnics is certainly does. The analytical solution nicely follows the FE LBA solution for global and local buckling. The 
   transition point lies is accurate up to a certain percentage which is very nice.

 Analytical model next steps:
 - The last step that would really finish up the thesis is to connect the analytical model back to the DNS simulations. I dicussed this a bit
   more with Ondrej as well and he has some ideas too.
 - Since infinitely rigid islands can not exist in reality or DNS we consider a cruciform hole where we vary the ratio between length of thick
   and thin segments.
 - What we have to think about is comming up with an equivalent ratio (rho) for cruciform holes such that we can place the result of the DNS
   simulations in the graph and verify its accuracy.
 - For consistency we will make use of LBA on the 2x2 cruciform example instead of bifurcation analysis to obtain the critical loads.
 - This is not implemented yet and Ondrej will provide me with some code.

TASKS THIS WEEK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Set up structure draft paper
 - Compare analytical model back DNS LBA 2x2 cruciform and think of equivalent rho
