NOTES MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - maybe linear hole scaling inside RVE
 - Check deformation mode FE2 square holes
 - inclanation of ligaments inside RVE
 - start off with simple geometry 
 - vary scale ratio RVE
 - Pattering dependencie on horizontal periodicity
  - test odd and even amount of periodic copies and see if there is a difference between deformations

 - start with DNS then go to FE2 and MM.


SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Discussion results last week:
  - It turns out the problem with the faulty compression of elements was due to a typo in the application of the DBC. I forgot to include a 
    d in the reconstruction of the constraint nodes. After correction the model now works as expected and nicely.
  - The error of the MM scheme is very small for all cases using 5% compression and scale ratio of 4 except for a few cases. Big-small-big 
    simulations where global buckling occured deviated from the DNS. However the MM is perfectly able to accurately capture micromorphic
    bucklinkg. It would be interesting to test a slightly bigger compression ratio to trigger global buckling in more cases and sooner.
 - With the model working we can start to think about exploring the possible design space we have at hand. We discussed several possibilities
  - Rectangular holes are a good option. First of all we are interested in the deformation mode of RVEs using rectangular holes with a
    default orientation. This can be tested using FE2 and checking whether there is a specific pattern to destinguish in the deformed RVE.
  - Changing the orientation of ligaments of RVEs using rectangular holes. The goals would be to see the specific patterning mode flow
    through the deformed mesh. We would start out with the DNS to check whether it is possible at all and then later apply the same
    microstructure with the MM to hopefully match the behaviour we see in the DNS.
  - The approach of this method is to start out with DNS and very simple geometry and check whether it is possible to indeed get some
    patterning mode to flow through the structure. Orientation and offset of holes are the tools at hand. How to construct this is somewhat
    tricky and can take some time.
  - Another possibility would be to change the scale ratio depending on the location of the RVE in the macroscopic mesh.
  - A third possi
  - Since we are testing on a semi-infinite strip periodicity should be taken into account. The preferred deformed configuration is the one 
    with the least energy. I should make horizontal copies and evaluate the normalized energy of each simulation. The one with the least
    energy would be the preferred state.
