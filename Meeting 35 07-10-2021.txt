SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Today's meeting was a bit harder for me to follow. I had trouble with understanding the high level concepts that Ondrej and Ron put out.
 - Mainly discussed the single column model and how to approach it from an analytical perspective. It turns out it is more complex than we
   had thought.

Single column model
 - In short, I showed him the different buckling modes of single column with various boundary conditions and that we think it is not possible
   to obtain both global and local buckling using a single column without the aid of translational and rotational springs.
 - He agreed on the rotational springs but still found the translational springs hard to place in a physical context. Ondrej had the argument
   about minimization of curvature which somewhat made sense to Ron.
 - Ron suggested to connect a horizontal column as well to the model and then construct both a model with b.c. for global and local buckling.
   We would then compute the buckling modes and the lower one of the two would occur first based on the assumption of minimization of energy.
   In a more discrete way, using only three elements this model would also allow us to set up an analytical model giving us insight in the 
   internal energy of the beams for various thickness ratios. We would call this solution the L-bracket.
 - To test whether it is actually possible to get local and global buckling in these cases we would take it to the extreme where we will
   make on column section rigid and hopefully we will see that the beam buckles locally then.
 - Another approach we thought of at the end of the meeting was to think of the thin beams as leaf springs and the thick beams as rigid
   islands. By increasing or decreasing the size of those islands we should change the location of the bending moments and go from global to
   local buckling. Ron mentioned that this could also be a feasible way to set up an analytical model.

Frame model and connection to single column model
 - We showed that the single column model is able to capture global and local buckling however the quantitative comparison between the frame
   model (actual mechanics) and single column model is not accurate. The single column model buckles locally much sooner than the frame model.
   Hence Ron suggested that we could only use this single column model to get qualitative comparison but not quantitative with which I agree.
   It thus turns out that the effect of the horizontal beam can not simply be described using a horizontal spring and that the effect of the
   horizontal beam including geometric stiffness matrix has to be taken into account. 

Meeting with just Ondrej
 - After the meeting with Ron it still was not perfectly clear to me what I could do in practice therefore I still spoke with Ondrej for a
   bit.
 - He mentioned that before we would move to a full analytical model we would first do a proof of concept for both modeling approaches.
   So set up two models one for global and one for local. Do the LBA and see what if the lowest eigenvalues correspond to the buckling modes
   we expect from the frame analysis. If they do not match we should probably take into account non-linear effects in the BA. 
 - I should do these proof of concepts for both models:
   - leaf spring model
   - L-bracket model
 - On a technical level Ondrej mentioned that implementing both methods should not be too difficult. I have most of the components already at
   the place.
   For global buckling I should make sure that the rotations are all the same and linked. Thus periodicity and let the horizontal displacement
   of the horizontal bar remain free.
   For local bucklinkg I should maek sure that to implement symmetry condidionts. So some rotations are opposite. Fix horizontal displacement
   of horizontal bar.
