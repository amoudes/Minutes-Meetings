DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks last week:
 DONE	 	- Adapt DNS code for the inifinite strip; Implement condensation method
      
                - Adapt the homogenization methods (FE2, MM) for the infinite strip; use Lagrange multipliers with null-space projection
 DONE            - FE2
 NOT DONE        - MM

		Q - RUN_micromorphic_2d_compression.m - Discuss tying constraints. 
				       		      

		Q - solve_rC_micromorphic_Lag.m - line 20 - What is different in the computation of the Hessian and forces in 
							    Niter = 1 and what should be included in Niter ~= 1?
				 		- line 42 - What is the lambda parameter and what does is it do?
				 		- General: Check entire code of constraint solver.
		
		Q - solve_rC_micromorphic_Lag.m does not converge. Not sure what the problem is.

 		Q - Periodic FE2 both Lagrange and condensation are much faster than non-periodic. Why?


	        - Implement variable hole size in DNS, FE2 and MM
 DONE 		 - DNS
 DONE 		 - FE2
 NOT DONE        - MM

 NOT DONE       - Perform analysis on macroscopic mesh:
                 - test for element size
                 - test for element type
                 - check for error compared to DNS
 
 NOT DONE        - Run analysis. Use:
                  - Variable hole size
                  - Square hole size - Relevent since TO will likely result in horizontal and vertical struts

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Implementation of PBC on the DNS and FE2 appears to have gone well. No critical points or points of improvement for the
   code.
 - The quick results I did last minute showed what we expect. 
    - DNS for b-s-b does show global buckling but this is with a steep gradient. Probably will be less if the gradient is 
      smaller.
    - FE2 with varying hole size shows no global buckling. Compressiveness and lack off shows that varying hole size is
      affecting the simulation.
    - MM have not been done yet since I had questions about setting up the solver.
 - General comments about the micromorphic code:
    - Structure seems fine. Bifurcation analysis should work.
    - I should also include DBC on the vi fields. Originally it was periodic in x and y, now only in x so vi field should
      be constrained in y.
    - I can avoid using the LDT decomposition of the Hessian. Instead direcly use Matlab's backslash operator to solve for
      displacements.
    - Apply the Q transformation on the eigenvector after K1t decomposition.
 - In the micromorphic solver I included a force part in the extended gradient for each iteration. This should only be done
   in the first Newton iteration. In the first iteration you only apply 'dtDBC' (the fraction of the full DBC) to make sure
   you do not completely snap over elements in the first Newton iteration. In later iterations this is okay since the
   elements compress equally over the domain and tDBC + dtDBC can be used instead. For this reason only include the force
   in the first Newton iteration in the EG.
 - Tying constraints (MC) seems okay. Implementation seems okay too.
 - Lambda in the solver contains all the Lagrange multipliers. Lambda multiplied with displacements yields a force vector.
   Hence Lambda are energies?.
