SUMMARY MEETING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 - Solver issues MM:
  - Upon closer inspection the solver problems most likely originate in the Cu - B = 0 part. It appears that the displacements are not updated
    each iteration. Therefore C = const and u = const and so the aforementioned equation can never be satisfied. Derivation of the system of 
    equations showed why Cu = B is important and why u needs to be updated with each iteration.
  - Moving the update displacement term inside the loop should solve the problem. During the meeting we ran a quick M2x2 simulation and it 
    appeared to run well. It was able to run past the bifurcation analysis which it had not been doing before.
  - Should there still be problems with the simulation an approach I could take is to run the simulation until the bifurcation point on the
    cluster, save the workspace and load it locally and see what the bifurcation is doing after. Disect where necessary. After all using the
    this solver and macroscopic periodicity should work and the solver should be capable of solving it.
  - The perturbation study showed that you have to find an optimal perturbation 'kick' size. Too big and you overshoot the minimum and too
    small and you will not kick the solution into a stable configuration.
  - Periodicity checks still need to be performed on the v fields. On first glance they appear to be okay.
  - When bifurcation on the v1 field is triggered this field should be non-zero. v0x & v0y can be (virtually) zero.
  - The S-shape deformation would not be expected since it is not the lowes deformation be mode (it is the second). It could however be
    possible. We should see what the slender periodic specimens will do before drawing conclusion. Horizontal deformations is small though
    compared to overal specimen size.
 - Mesh convergence study:
  - The DNS simulation showed decent flattening of the final stress and energy levels at CellSize/8 -> Henceforth I should use this value
    (I already came to the same conclusion).
  - FE2 did not show any dependency on the mesh size. Which makes sense since we are essentially performing the same homogeneous deformation
    on each element. This is only valid when having a constant RVE in the entire macroscopic specimen. For varying RVEs there should be a 
    dependency on the macroscopic mesh.
  - For now FE2 with a 2x8 Q16 element configuration should be fine.
  - The MM mesh convergence study should still be performed.
 - Variable hole size study:
  - DNS; The DNS simulations showed global buckling for too large gradients. The region of interest is the part where the deformation pattern is 
    able to fully develop throughout the specimen.
  - DNS; In the P22 and energy plots and kicks and bumps and softening are explained by the shift towards global buckling.
  - DNs; In the sbs case for large gradients a secondary bifurcation point is introduced. The first is due to the onset of the patterning mode
    the second point is global buckling.
  - DNS; Some simulations were not able to completely finish. I could evaluate deformation at earlier timepoint to still have comparable
    results. The simulations that were not able to finish lie in the region in which we are not interested so not too important to make them
    work.
  - FE2; Deformation is very localized. Only few elements show very soft behaviour. Due to lack of connection between cells only a small band
    of cells are affected. In the MM we expect the deformation to be more gradual and evenly spread through the specimen.
  - FE2; For the large gradients simulations are too not able to fully finish. This is not a problem since it can be evaluated at an earlier
    time point.
  - Comp; FE2 shows much softer behaviour than DNS. Since holes there is a form of communication between holes/cells in the DNS, this
    constraint can be regared as an additional stiffness. FE2 lacks any form of communication thus the softer elements make sense.
    The FE2 error also reflects this observation. All FE2 values are (much) lower than the MM ones.
 - Square holes:
  - I showed some early results and they look good.
  - It makes sense to have rectangular inclusions instead of perfect squares. By doing so we would be able to increase and decrease ligament
    thickness.
  - Orientation seems good.
 - In the following include a quadratic hole size gradient. Periodic might not be relevant in the following.
