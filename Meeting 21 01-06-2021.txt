DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks last week:
 DONE 		- Test MM simulations - find good solver settings
 
 DONE		- Mesh convergence study MM
		  C - This changed to a size factor study. Size factor of ~4 seems to avoid S-shape for constant hole size

 DONE		- Coarse MM D2 study
		  C - Discuss results
		  Q - Elements at the edge are compressed much more than center elements. Even so far that is causes mesh distortion.
		  Q - A single patterning mode phi for each RVE gives problems since discretization for meshes with different hole sizes is 
                      gives different amount of nodes and elements. My current approach is to constuct a fine "master RVE mesh" using a large
                      hole diameter and use it to find interpolated values for RVEs with different hole sizes/shapes.

 NOT DONE	- Fine D2 study:
  		 - DNS
  		 - FE2
  		 - MM

 NOT DONE	- Rectangular holes DNS, FE2, MM


		  C - Discuss general progress project (planning, where we should be by now, ...)
