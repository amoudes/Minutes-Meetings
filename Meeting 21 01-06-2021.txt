DISCUSSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks last week:
 DONE 		- Test MM simulations - find good solver settings
 
 DONE		- Mesh convergence study MM
		  C - This changed to a size factor study. Size factor of ~4 seems to avoid S-shape for constant hole size

 DONE		- Coarse MM D2 study
		  C - Discuss results
		  Q - Elements at the edge are compressed much more than center elements. Even so far that is causes mesh distortion.
		  Q - A single patterning mode phi for each RVE gives problems since discretization for meshes with different hole sizes is 
                      gives different amount of nodes and elements. My current approach is to constuct a fine "master RVE mesh" using a large
                      hole diameter and use it to find interpolated values for RVEs with different hole sizes/shapes.

 NOT DONE	- Fine D2 study:
  		 - DNS
  		 - FE2
  		 - MM

 NOT DONE	- Rectangular holes DNS, FE2, MM


		  C - Discuss general progress project (planning, where we should be by now, ...)

SUMMARY MEETING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The problem with the S-shape is due to the small scale ratio. In situations where the S-shape occurred the macroscopic domain essentially
   consisted out of four holes. Since size effects do play a role in MM scheme this is what happened. With increasing domain size and 
   constant hole size the S-hape quickly became non prominent. Though judging from the interpolation plots (v0x, v0y, v1) it seems that v0x 
   still would like to deform in to an S-shape upon micromorphic bifurcation, when secondary buckling instigates it hopefully would like to 
   deform in the longenst possible wavelength.
 - A scale ratio of four seems to be fine and within the computational realms of the DNS. I should make sure to use a smaller compression 
   <10% when using a larger scale ratio to prevent snapping through elements/holes. (The DNS had problems solving 10% compression when scale
   ratio was 4).
 - In the size factor study we see that for large scale ratios wave like patterns pop up in the v1 field. This is attributed to the large 
   step size from deformation to no deformation at the edges. To compensate for this rapid jump in v1 values (using quadratic elements) 
   negative countervalues needs to exist. A parallel can be drawn with a sharp cut-off in a Fourier series. Here we also see oscillations 
   pop up at the edges. This is not something to worry about. Simply using finer macroscopic discretization should solve it. However since 
   we will not be using such a large scale ratio, the effects should be negligebly small.
 - The comment made in the email about an individual patterning mode phi for each RVE was actually implemented correctly. The comment was
   that it seemed like there were multiple patterning modes acting on one macroscopic domain. This was actually not the case. In fact the 
   patterning mode is described using one analytical expression (Fourier series) which acts on the entire RVE-domain. Since it is an
   analytical expression it can act on different RVEs. There is no need to apply an interpolated approach such as the one I implemented 
   after I received the comment. I can therefore change it back to how it was before which should not be a problem.
 - Variable hole size for the MM gave some mixed results. The v1 fields look like what we would expect from the MM scheme. They are activated
   in the correct areas where the holes are the largest (more compliant). The deformation of the mesh on the other hand is less accurate.
   Elements at the edge compress much more then elements at the center. Deformation is less equally distributed throughout the mesh than it
   should be. It is not clear why this is so.
   For example, the small-big-small elements show much deformation at the mesh boundaries while the most compliant elements are located at the
   center.
   Upon close inspection, pre-bifurcation (so in the FE2 regime) deformation is not equally distributed while it should be. This is a problem 
   as the MM therefore does not give reliable results.
  - To locate the issue I should retrace the steps I took and see if the problem pops up in previous versions of the code.
  - I should also take a loot at the RVE meshes at the element macroscopic boundaries to check for any distortions or ill shaped elements.
  - If I do not find the solution before Friday I should contact Ondrej so he can have a look.
